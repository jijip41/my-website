Hello!üññ Thanks for visiting my website repository. 
This is the website I created to apply for the Founders and Coders 2021 Autumn courseüë©‚Äçüíª. 

I've been learning to code from scratch, following FreeCodeCamp online curriculum and many other tutorials and documents available online. I also practiced to improve my JavaScript knowledge by regularly completing katas on Codewars. Most importantly, I've met amazing people through the FAC's community and we've been supporting each other through our journey's to become developers. So I highly recommend it if you're in a similar situation.

The website is a one page design and you can jump around different sections by clicking the nav menu. The menu includes 5 sections:

Section 1Ô∏è‚É£: Home
I've created a function to greet you all. You can see "Hello there I'm Jihye I'm looking for a deverloper job!" with a typing effect. You can stop this effect by clicking button below the text. 
You will also be able to see 3 videos in a video carousel. I recorded them to show a preview of my work which I created by following online tutorials in my spare time. To see the next video, you can click the arrow buttons on the left and right side of the video. You can also click the smaller images just below the video.

Section 2Ô∏è‚É£: About me
This section provides a bit of information about myself. If you click each image you will be able to see different content explaining more about me.

Section 3Ô∏è‚É£ : Why FAC?
If you are using desktop, you might have a screen which is big enough to see the lovely yellow flowers. Each flower is clickable and if you click on them they will disappear and you will find the reason why I applied for FAC's Autumn course. Please make sure to remove all the flowers to read the 7 reasons why I applied for the course. 

Section 4Ô∏è‚É£: FAC Requirements
On desktop, you will find a nice animation when you hover the 3 requirements.  After clicking each one you will be able to see if I completed each requirement. You can also click the text on the bottom to go onto my account for each website.

Section 5Ô∏è‚É£: Contact
Like other websites, you can submit a form to contact me. Make sure that you fill all the fields before you click the Submit button. Otherwise, you will get a warning message!
